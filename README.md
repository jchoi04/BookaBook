## Introduction

**BookaBook** is my group's project for SBUHack's 2024 hackathon! Created by a team of four, this was the first project each of us had ever made. We've had no previous experience with
any [technology](technologies-used) or languages used in this project, and we had to learn everything as we created BookaBook within 36 hours. 


## Project Inspiration/Concept

As students inspired by the challenges of finding reliable sources for the cheapest known textbooks available, we sought to create a user-driven
platform that would be reliable and easily accessible. Users could browse or search for their textbooks and find user-provided and user-supported resources.
Students upload textbooks with a way to get the textbook, and peers can upvote if they find the source reliable. 


## Technologies Used

- **Flask**: the web framework to build the server-side logic.
- **Bootstrap**: the CSS framework used to style our webpage.
- **FIGMA**: interface design web app used for initial design plans for UI/UX.


## Future Changes/Additions

- **Database**: We would add a database such as MongoDB where we could store user accounts and their listings, and we would store information on the textbooks
 available to view on our website.

- **Website Changes**: We would make the login/signup pages functional, and change the subjects files/pages (math.html, science.html, forLang.html, etc.)
so that it would call upon the database to display the textbooks and their descriptions instead of putting that information in our subjects' files. We would also make the search bar
fully functional so that it would refer to our database containing the textbooks we have and display search results.



Disclaimer:
This website is not fully functional, and we were only able to create a somewhat working website to display our vision. The login/signup pages do not store user input, 
and users are not currently able to upload listings. Additionally, the only functional textbook page that is working would be /calc1, and the only search that 
works in the search bar would be if you input "calc 1".
